# othello-Game
Othello is a classic board game and can only be played by 2 players just like chess, checkers and go. The game board is made up of 8 rows and 8 columns. The board consist of 64 square boxes .we play this game with 64 discs. They are colored black on one side and white on the other. This way, they can be flipped to the other color easily. One player plays discs black side up, the other white side up. After the first 4 initial discs are placed, black open the game. You can play a disc when you flank one or more opponents discs between your new disc and any other of your own discs, in the same horizontal, vertical or diagonal line. The opponent's discs that are flanked will be turned upside-down and change color. When there is no possible legal move, the turn is given back to the opponent. When both players need to pass because there is no legal move left, the game has ended. The discs are counted. Whoever has the most discs wins the board game. Play versus better human players. Don't play against computers as they are very hard to beat.
